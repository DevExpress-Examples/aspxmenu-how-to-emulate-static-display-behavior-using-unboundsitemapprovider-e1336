# ASPxMenu - How to emulate static display behavior using UnboundSiteMapProvider


<p>This example demonstrates how a static display feature, similar to a standard Menu control's StaticDisplayLevels property, can be implemented using the ASPxMenu control, together with the UnboundSiteMapProvider component.<br />
In this example, an UnboundSiteMapProvider (whose ID is tempProvider) is used as an ASPxMenu's data source. When creating the UnboundSiteMapProvider, top level nodes are moved to the root level, so that they appear on the same level as the Home node.</p>
